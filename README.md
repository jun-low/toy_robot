# Toy Robot Simulator

The Toy Robot exercise was originally developed by Jon Eaves. He explains why he did it in [here](https://joneaves.wordpress.com/2014/07/21/toy-robot-coding-test/).
This exercise is intended to practice about Test Driven Development (TDD).

## Getting Started
A simulation of a toy robot moving on a square tabletop, of dimensions 5 units x 5 units. 
See [Specification](https://github.com/jun-low/toy_robot#specification) below for details.
